    <p>Welcome to 1998! :-)</p>
    <h3>Particular achievements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding and debugging the third party softwareSUMO(Simulation of Urban MObility) [citation
            needed] thatwe used for the traffic simulation. Creating automated reproduction scenarios
            of oddities observed in the simulation tracking down their cause sometimes in consultation with the
            SUMO user group.</li>
        <li>Visualising the SUMO data in the traffic client. Interpolating motion and orientation of the vehicles.
            Interpolating the vehicle positions along splines connecting them was done by our lead developer for
            which I provided some mathematical support and then I built on that work to to ensure that the vehicle
            kinematics were those of a car being driven by its wheels. This is a perfect example of where my
            physicist past came in handy as the usual treatments of vehicle turning kinematics derive the motion
            of the body of the vehicle from its wheels as that is where the the motive force comes from. However
            SUMO uses the front bumper as the vehicle position so vehicle body and corresponding wheel motion
            had to be determined from this. Solving the problem mathematically and then turning it into
            code. Ensuring that the code remains performant.
            Added vehicle types which introduced subtleties about representing the right type of vehicle with a
            correct type but randomised prefab. Involved adding new messages to the protocol, amending the
            server, road editor and traffic client to handle vehicle classes and ensure consistency between the vehicle
            distribution generated by the road editor and represent by the client.</li>
        <li>collision avoidance. The driving simulator had a problem of traffic vehicles occasionally driving through
            the driver. This was due to 0.5sec of lag between where the sriver saw ones self with respect to the
            traffic and where the SUMO simulation thoguht that the driver was. Not being able to further bring
            that delay time down on account of needing to buffer some vehicle positions for the spline interpolation
            between them we had to detect when a collision was about to happen and slow the offending
            traffic vehicle down to avoid the collision. The catch is that then this needs to be communcated back
            to the simulation via the server to keep them synchronised. One of the ways in which MXT’sSUMO
            visualisationwas uniquewas that itwas (nearly) real-time and interactive. Itwas vital to not break this
            for an immersive experience.</li>
        <li>creation of traffic in the Road Editor. Exporting SUMO files, creating traffic based on pathfinding
            vehicle distributions (increasing fidelity of traffic realism/distribution) duration/density parameters
            Ensuring realistic distributions (maths physics skills also come in handy here). Ensuring that it is locally
            realistic but globally not necessarily. Adding functionality to be able to control aspects of traffic:
            configuring traffic lights, improving the pathfinding, editor tooling</li>
        <li>using Python to analyse and correct automatically generated SUMO (checkign for sliding, traffic
            jams). DOne in Python using some of SUMO’s Python tools.</li>
        <li>learning about the legacy code via pair programming</li>
        <li>prototyped a road modeller to generate SUMO traffic consonant with traffic density</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>solving the mathematical/logical problem and turnign the solution into code</li>
        <li>maintiaining and developing legacy code</li>
        <li>debugging unfamiliar systems (ROE & SUMO)</li>
        <li>some experience of design (LOOP, prototype load modeller)</li>
    </ul>
