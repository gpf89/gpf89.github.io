              I am a physicist having transitioned into Virtual Reality. During this transition I became interested in the capacity of games 
              & VR as a means of learning about the abstract ideas of maths and physics recruiting the intuitive and experiential faculties 
              of the human body to supplement its analytical ones. As a guiding principle I hold that virtual reality, for this purpose, should 
              not aim to provide a facsimile of reality but make available otherwise inaccessible realms of experience in ways in which it is 
              uniquely positioned, amongst the other technologies, to do.

              I worked at MXT on traffic and infrastructure visualisation. My responsibility was making sure that traffic looked and behaved realistically
              and ran smoothly. Bringing the analytical & numerical faculties and the practice of comparing a contructed model to observations of reality 
              and engaging in its recursive refinement from physics I could find a place in the team where I could bring these skills to bear on refining 
              the traffic in our driving simulator while gaining full-stack experience in its implementation.

              I spent my physics career boradly in the area of optics with a detour into electron optics. 
              <a href="https://theses.gla.ac.uk/7475/">My thesis</a> dealt with three fairly disparate problems broadly fitting into the category 
              of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#%22Which-way%22_experiments_and_the_principle_of_complementarity">
              <i>which-path</i></a> problems. After some more study of the quantum properties of light in the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/qtg/">Quantum Theory Group</a> at the University 
              of Glasgow I spent some time in classical imaging at in the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/optics/">Optics</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/imagingconcepts/">
              Imaging Concepts</a> groups and electron miscroscope analysis of semiconductor samples in the <a href="https://ssd.phys.strath.ac.uk/">SSD</a> group at the University of Strathclyde. My programming experience here includes contributions to the relativistic ray-tracer

              I try to look at life through as many lenses as I can. My artistic interest include <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.art/?hl=en">
              drawing</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.music/?hl=en">music</a>. My journey in these has been almost entirely autodidactic 
              and have been greatly instructive in learning how to learn. I occasionally <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.science/?hl=en">combine art 
              and physics</a> in trying to illustrate physical concepts through an artistic rather than academic medium.
