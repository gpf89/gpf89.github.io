        <p>
          I am a physicist having transitioned into Virtual Reality. During this transition I became interested in the capacity of games 
          & VR as a means of learning about the abstract ideas of maths and physics recruiting the intuitive and experiential faculties 
          of the human body to supplement its analytical ones. As a guiding principle I hold that virtual reality, for this purpose, should 
          not aim to provide a facsimile of reality but make available otherwise inaccessible realms of experience in ways in which it is 
          uniquely positioned, amongst the other technologies, to do.
        </p>
        <h2>Virtual reality</h2>
        I morked at MXT on traffic and infrastructure visualisation. My responsibility was making sure that traffic looked and behaved realistically
        and ran smoothly. Bringing the analytical & numerical faculties and the practice of comparing a contructed model to observations of reality 
        and engaging in its recursive refinement from physics I could find a place in the team where I could bring these skills to bear on refining 
        the traffic in our driving simulator while gaining full-stack experience in its implementation.
        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <p>
          I spent my physics career boradly in the area of optics with a detour into electron optics. 
          <a href="https://theses.gla.ac.uk/7475/">My thesis</a> dealt with three fairly disparate problems broadly fitting into the category 
          of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#%22Which-way%22_experiments_and_the_principle_of_complementarity">
          <i>which-path</i></a> problems. After some more study of the quantum properties of light in the Quantum Theory Group at the University 
          of Glasgow I spent some time in classical imaging at in the Optics and Imaging concepts groups and electron miscroscope analysis of 
          semiconductor samples. My programming experience here includes contributions to the relativistic ray-tracer 
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465513003767">DrTIM</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The rest of life</h2>
        <p>
          I try to look at life through as many lenses as I can. My artistic interest include <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.art/?hl=en">
          drawing</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.art/?hl=en">music</a>. My journey in these has been almost entirely autodidactic 
          and have been greatly instructive in learning how to learn. I occasionally <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gferenczi.science/?hl=en">combine art 
          and physics</a> in trying to illustrate physical concepts through an artistic rather than academic medium.
