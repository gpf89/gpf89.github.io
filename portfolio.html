                    <a href="https://www.mxt.co.uk">MXT</a>'s driving simulator is a networked system with a Python server running a SUMO simulation and a Unity client, written in C#, interfacing with a motion rig.
                    In its most recent incarantion it has been adapted into a desktop experience. It has analytics capabilities including gaze tracking, the possibility of ECG monitoring and vehicle path tracking.
                    It has been used in several <a href="https://www.mxt.co.uk/case-studies/dhs/">driver response studies</a> by <a href="https://www.arup.com/">ARUP</a> and <a href="https://www.wsp.com/">WSP</a>.
                    Our in-house Road Editor tool also built in Unity allowed for the creation of road networks compliant with the <a href="https://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/dmrb">Design Manual for Roads and 
                    Bridges</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-signs-manual">Traffic Signs manual</a>. While the road network is fictional the environment was created based on 
                    Lidar data of a region in the Lake District.

        <h3>Aesthetic realism</h3>
        <p>
            Improved the realistic appearance of traffic by introducing various vehicle types into the SUMO simulation and ensuring their appropriate representation on the client. I made improvements
            to the pathfinding algorithm to provide better control over the tunability of the traffic, employing tricks bespoke to the road networks geometry where possible, ensuring realistic looking 
            traffic on a fictional road network that is nevertheless  I implemented vehicle lights taking information all the way from the SUMO simulation to the shaders. 

        </p>
        <h3>Vehicle kinematics</h3>    
        <p>
            I improved the realism of the motion of the traffic. Building on the system in place for interpolating position and speed between the sparse data of the simulation (every 0.2 seconds) I 
            implemented realistic vehicle kinematics including ones dragging trailers. Whereas in usual treatments of this problem give the motion and rotation of the vehicle chasis as a function of
            the motion of the wheels, due to the information available the motion and the wheels and rotation of the chasis had to be infered from its motion. Two physics degrees proved very useful in 
            solving the problem anaytically and I implemented the solution as performant code in Unity's Jobs system.

        <h3>Collision avoidance</h3>
        <p>
            The novelty of MXT's use of SUMO was as a real time interactive tool. On account of having to interpolate paths splines between the sparse data the client saw a game state 0.5sec behind that
            of the simulation. Game breaking artefacts arising as a result were solved with client side collision detection. Working in collaboration with our lead developer we built a system
            to detect impending collisions and slow the offending vehciles along their paths computed by the SUMO simulation with it being able to take input at runtime. I created the automated test scenes
            and implemented the necessary communication between the simulation run on the server and the interactive visualisation run by the client while my colleague implemented collision detection.

                    SUMO vehicle. Hence it appears to not take it into account. The gizmos show the impending collision being detected by the client.

        <h3>Editor tooling</h3>
        <p>
            Alongisde aforementioned work on the traffic creation functionality of our Road Editor tool I helped maintain, debug & develop the its road network editing functionality. In particular
            I adapted the traffic light system to allow signals to be duplicated and placed according to regulations laid out in Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual.

        <h2>LOOP</h2>
        <p>
            LOOP was a redesign of the in-house <b>Ro</b>ad <b>E</b>ditor tool. Whereas the previous tool was suited to creating fictional road networks from scratch LOOP was oriented towards data 
            based creation of existing and proposed road network and infrastructure. It used the OpenDRIVE standard for serializing road networks and interacted with libOpenDrive via a transaction system. 
            In the absence of traffic density data it proved challenging to create realistic traffic without resorting to tools and methods bespoke to the road network geometry. As part of this new road network 
            creation tool I prototyped, in a joint effort with our lead developer, a tool for generating SUMO traffic that approximates measured traffic density on its real life counterpart.
        </p>
        <h3>Prototype Load Modeller</h3>
        <p>
            Traffic density on a road network can be specified in two basic ways. Either one can specify how many vehicles traverse any given road in the network per hour or the transition rate at each intersection 
            for each turn that can be taken with the latter providing more realistic traffic should the entire trajectory of the vehicle be followed in the simulation. We achieved this by representing the transition 
            rates at each juntion as a matrix of numbers and defining adjacency between the matrices. This way we could randomly generates pick routes decrementing the appropriate entry in each matrix as that jucntion 
            is traversed.
